This repository contains an example of an uncommon bug in HTML. The bug involves a race condition where a script tries to modify a DOM element before the browser has finished rendering it.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as elements not being visible or other unexpected issues. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this race condition by using an event listener to ensure the element is ready before manipulation.
